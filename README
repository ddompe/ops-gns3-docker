# OpenSwitch Docker files for GNS3

This repository holds Dockerfiles that can be used to build images that are useful
inside GNS3 container environments for demo purposes.

The following images are available:

## OpenSwitch
Creates an openswitch container image out of the appliance tarball.
The genericx86-64 images from openswitch can't be used with GNS3, since the port
map is incompatible.

Example to build this image:

```
cd openswitch
docker build -t openswitch-appliance:local .

```

## Ubuntu
Creates a system container image with Ubuntu for GNS3 labs.

```
cd ubuntu
docker build -t ubuntu:gns3 .
```

If you are behind a corporate firewall you may want to pass the information about
the proxy during the build:
```
docker build --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy -t ubuntu:gns3 .
```
