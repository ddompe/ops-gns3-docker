This repository contains helper scripts to running OpenSwitch in container mode inside GNS3.

To use GNS3 with OpenSwitch, you need a tar.gz file with the filesystem from OpenSwitch's 
appliance target (no, you cannot use the genericx86-64, since his port layout is 
incompatible with GNS3). But the appliance images is targeted to run on real hardware, so
there is some minor adjustments that need to be done in order to run smoothly on a container
environment.

The generate-docker-image.sh script modifies an appliance tarball to be suitable for use as
container in GNS3.
