This repository holds Dockerfiles that can be used to build images that are useful
inside GNS3 container environments for demo purposes.

The following images are available:

- OpenSwitch: creates an openswitch container image out of the appliance tarball.
  The genericx86-64 images from openswitch can't be used with GNS3, since the port
  map is incompatible.

- Ubuntu: creates a system container image with Ubuntu for GNS3 labs.
